# Finch Robot Project – Dance Project

## 📌 Project Description

This project uses a Finch 2.0 robot programmed in Java to complete the dancine routine challenge. The robot uses movement and sensors to create an interactive behavior.

---

## 🎯 Objectives

* Apply Java to real world creativity
* Implement robot behavior using the Finch API
* Practice problem-solving and debugging in a computing environment

---

## 🧠 Design Choices

* Chose the dance routine because: it was simple, innovative, and fun.
* Used the following OOP concepts:

  * [ ] Loops (for, while)
  * [ ] Conditional statements (if/else)
  * [ ] Arrays / ArrayLists
  * [ ] Static methods or constants
  * [ ] User input

We stored dance moves in an array and used a loop to repeat them in sync with light or sound.

## 🛠️ Challenges & Solutions

**Challenge 1**: Robot drifted when turning or moving fast

**Solution**: We reduced the motor speed slightly to make the movements more stable and consistent. Slowing down the turns helped keep the robot in place during the routine.

**Challenge 2**: Timing the robot's movements to sync with the music

**Solution**: We had to experiment with different durations and adjust motor speeds to match the beat. After some trial and error, we matched the movement rhythm with the tones.

## 🚀 Future Enhancements

* Add more user input controls
* Improve sensor accuracy
* Add more advanced choreography
* Save data to a file or add maze learning
